# Love Confession Game  

A playful and interactive tkinter app that lets you confess your love in a fun way! The "YES" button expresses mutual love, while the "NO" button hilariously avoids your click.  

## Features  
- **Interactive UI**: Respond to the question with "YES" or try catching the elusive "NO" button.  
- **Dynamic Behavior**: The "NO" button moves randomly when hovered over, making it impossible to click.

## How It Works  
1. Launch the app.  
2. Read the question: *"I Love You, Do You Love Me?"*  
3. Click "YES" to express your love.  
4. Try to click "NO" if you dareâ€”it won't make it easy!  

## Code Highlights
